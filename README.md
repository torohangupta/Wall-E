Wall-E is a Discord Bot written in JavaScript using [`Discord.JS`](https://discord.js.org/#/) on the `Node.js` server side runtime environment. Wall-E began as a personal project during the satrt of the COVID-19 pandemic, written to fulfill needs that were not able to be met by other bots and evolved to become the primary automated system for managing [Online College](https://discord.gg/ecBCdrt). Wall-E is currently hosted on the free tier of the Heroku scalable cloud hosting platform.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out on Discord by my username, `rohangupta#8570` & I hope this bot/project helps you in some way.

# Online College
![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?color=gray&label=&query=presence_count&suffix=%20Members%20Online&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com%2Fapi%2Fguilds%2F692094440881520671%2Fwidget.json&logo=discord&logoColor=white&style=flat&textcolor=black)

While looking for a more robust solution to communicate with classmates & friends, Discord was selected as the alternative to options such as Snapchat and GroupMe. In fall of 2019, Online College was created with the vision of it beocming a central hub for current, incoming and graduated students in the College of Engineering at Iowa State University for information, homework help and means to meet other students in the engineering disciplines.

The Wall-E project has transformed, integrating many features, such as:

- [x] Self-Assignable Class Clannels
- [x] Dynamic Voice Channels
- [x] Support Tickets
- [x] Integrated Application System
- [x] Poll & Voting

With many features planned such as:

- [ ] Automatic Moderation
- [ ] Manual Moderation Commands (Timeout, Warn, Ban)
- [ ] Moderation Logging Commands
- [ ] Major & Year Self-Assignment
- [ ] Rule `.md` files for easy updating

..and more! Got an idea? Feel free to contribute to the project!
